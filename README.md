# Light-Dark Mode "ReactFacts" Page

This project required adding a dynamic layout to an existing static page. This is a part of freeCodeCamp's React course (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8).

The codebase containing the static elements and css styling was provided. React.useState and an onClick handler were added to enable theme switching.
